Hi, I'm Neha. I am an Electrical Engineer turned Data Scientist. I love tinkering with Data in Python. 

- 🔭 I’m currently spending my time applying for jobs and working on my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. Also learning Tableau. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Data Analytics project. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with jobs and volunteer opportunities. <br>I'm also looking to network with people in the field, especially folks who have transitioned to Data Science.
- 💬 Ask me about any beginner/intermediate level questions you might have about data science libraries in python.
