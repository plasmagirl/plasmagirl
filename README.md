Hi, I'm Neha. I am an Electrical Engineer turned Data Scientist. I love working with Data in Python. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently spending my time applying for jobs and working on my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. Also learning Tableau. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Data Analytics project. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with jobs and volunteer opportunities. <br>I'm also looking to network with people in the field, especially folks who have transitioned to Data Science.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any beginner/intermediate level questions you might have about data science libraries in python. I come from a family of teachers and I love to teach.
