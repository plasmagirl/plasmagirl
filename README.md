Hi, I'm Neha. I am an Electrical Engineer turned Data Scientist. I love tinkering with Data in Python. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently spending my time applying for jobs and working on my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. Also learning [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/neha.nehru#!/). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Data Analytics project. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with jobs and volunteering opportunities. <br>I'm also looking to network with people in the field. Especially, folks who have transitioned to Data Science.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any beginner/intermediate level questions you might have about data science libraries in python.
